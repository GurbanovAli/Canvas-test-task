This Canvas, without Canvas test task for CODEX


# Task

Your task is to write a simple drawing program that executes a sequence of commands from the file Input.txt and produces output.txt.
Use the next commands:

C|  w  | h  |    |    |
-|-----|----|----|----|
L|  x1 | y1 | x2 | y2 |
R|  x1 | y1 | x2 | y2 |
B|  x  | y  |    |    |


Canvas : create canvas width w and height h.

Line : Line: draw a line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) using the pseudo-graphic symbol “x” for drawing.
Only horizontal and vertical lines are supported.

Rectangle: create a rectangle with the upper left corner at the point (x1, y1), the lower right corner at the point (x2, y2).
The vertical and horizontal lines should be drawn with pseudo-graphic “x” characters.

Bucket Fill: fill the entire area (x, y) with color ("color", c), similar to how the Fill tool works in graphic editors.
Important: you can draw only if the canvas is created!


Example: Examine the input.txt and output.txt files in the appendix to the task.
